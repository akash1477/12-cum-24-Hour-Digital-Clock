There are two files.
1) sim.pdsprj (this is the simulation file only)
2) sim and pcb.pdsprj (this includes the schematics and the pcb design in it)

Note: Open the files in Proteus v8.1 or more. Run the first file for simulation.
The working mode, i.e 12 Hour or 24 Hour is decided by the spdt Switch connected
to the pin 1 of the MUX (74LS157)
